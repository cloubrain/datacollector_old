Data collector for VMWare
CloubrAIn, Inc.

The data collector collects the data via VCenter in VMWare. It automatically sends the data to our server.

Java 1.6 or above must be installed and $JAVA_HOME defined. Edit "vCenter.config" file as below

vcenter_url=https://vcenter-host/sdk
vcenter_uid=admin_username
vcenter_pwd=admin_password
upload=true
host=ec_2.compute.amazonaws.com
perf_items=cpu.usagemhz.average,mem.usage.average
name=myDC (or any other desired name which will also be used alongwith your data for storing)

Send email to: data@cloubrain.com
to receive your Amazon server that will collect your data.
We have a ready made instance with mongoDB setup.
Set host=... in "vCenter.config" to the server we provide.

To start the collector, run
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar stats.jar vCenter.config
If successful, you will see collected stats on the console.

To create image files of visualization of your data, run
$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar stats.jar visualization
